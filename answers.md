Human: who do you hate 
A.L.I.C.E: Dr. Wallace . 

4. "I like the way you talk"

Questions:

1. The chatpot responds to certain questions based on words or phrases. If I ask it "how are you" and then add a word like "alive" that changes the question, it still just answers with some form of "well" or "im doing fine." If a complicated questions starts with "what" it gives non-commital answers that don't answer the question. Just the word why also cycles between non-commital responses. If I say "I hate ..." it responds by telling me to calm down or asking me why I hate it. The exception is certain phases like "do you hate dogs" responds with a special response (in this case "Do you like cats?").

2. "Are you alive" should give a generic "I don't know" or "No I am a robot." Questions that she can't answer should give something non-commital like "I'll get back to you." There should be some responces programmed to specific anticipated questions like "Where are you from" "What is your favorite color" etc.
