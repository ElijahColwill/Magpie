Activity 2:

Start:
My mother and I talked last night: "Tell me more about your family."
I said no!: "Why so negative?"
The weather is nice: "Interesting, tell me more."
Do you know my brother?: "Why so negative?"

Keywords:

weather: "I hope we get snow. Winter is my favorite season."
Rockies: "You have poor taste in baseball teams."
kms: "You should see a therapy dog."

Questions:

1. When multiple responses are in a query, they are prioritized based on the order of the if statements in the code. It will look for the word "No" before it looks for the word "Mother", so that can alter the response.

2. When given a sentence like with words like "know", the way the code is written will cause it to find the "no" in the middle of the word and base it's response off of that, so if the word "know" is anywhere in the string you give the AI, the responce will always be "Why so negative?"
